MapForSnacks

OVERVIEW

We are creating a software application that provides information on the availability of vending machine products on campus. This application will be useful to both faculty and students as it addresses the common inconvenience of finding nearby vending machines, as well as if their favorite snack or drink is in stock. What sets this project apart from other similar applications is that it involves real-time tracking.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

We intend to make a website to show which campus buildings have vending machines and where they are located in the building. The intended users will be the students attending the university and the faculty members. The features include a list of all the buildings on campus and what is out of stock in each vending machine. 

COMPUTATIONAL FEATURES

API Integration: 

    ✧ We will implement a Google Map API that can help students  find the nearest vending machine.
    ✧ Automatically update stock levels in real-time.

User Interface Design: 

    ✧ List View: Show availability status (“In stock,"  “Low stock,"  “ out of stock”) and active status (e.g., if the vending machine is out  of service or not).
    ✧ Color codes: Use color codes for each option to make it easier to understand.   
    ✧ Filter: Allow users to filter vending machines by availability.
    ✧ Search functionality: allow users to search for a specific item/brand across all vending machines on campus, showing  which vending machine has the searched item in stock.
    ✧ Display: When the user chooses a vending machine, it displays all the details of the available item, including  prices, quantities, and nutritional information (optional).
